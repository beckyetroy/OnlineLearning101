	<h2> Getting Outside and Breaking Up the Day </h2>
	<p class = "general">Working at a computer for hours at a time almost every day can certainly take a toll on your mental and physical health. When not managed correctly, solitary online learning can lead to a range of consequences from eye strain to long-term heart problems. Grades are important when learning online, but your health should come always come first!
	<br><br>
	That is why it is so important to get outside and break up your day in any way you can. Whether you are a physically active person or not, it is essential you bring some sort of balance into your college routine. Below are some suggestions for how to break up your day and look after your body and mind while online learning:

	<p class = "subgeneral">
		<h3>Move as Much as Possible at your Workspace </h3>
	</p>
	<p class = "subgeneral">
		This is a must-do when you find yourself in the one spot for hours at a time. Move, stretch, wiggle, change positions as much as you possibly can! Stand at your desk every so often if you can. Stretch your arms and legs at the desk. Jiggle your legs. Roll your shoulders. The more movement, the more bloodflow in your body and the better you will feel at the end of the day and in the long run too!

	<p class = "subgeneral">
		<h3>Get Fresh Air </h3>
	</p>
	<p class = "subgeneral">
		Fresh air from outside can make a huge difference to your mood, productivity, and health. Try to prioritise getting a little bit of fresh air every day while you're online learning. Set up outside to study (weather permitting), stand outside during your breaks, or at least try to keep a window open nearby.

	<img src = "images/Walking.jpg" alt = "Walking" class = "breakingUpTheDay">
	</p>

	<p class = "subgeneral">
		<h3>Go for a Walk</h3>
	</p>
	<p class = "subgeneral">
		Going for a walk is one of the easiest and most effective ways to break up your day at the computer. Bring the dog if you have a dog; go to the shop down the road if there is one - whatever it is that gets you out and about to stretch your legs and get some fresh air away from a screen!
		<br>

	<p class = "subgeneral">
	<img src = "images/exercise.jpg" alt = "Exercising" class = "breakingUpTheDay">

	<p class = "subgeneral">
		<h3>Try Exercising</h3>
	</p>
	<p class = "subgeneral">
		If you enjoy being active, don't let online learning get in the way of staying active. Keep up any sports or physical activities you enjoy - like running or going to the gym. If you're considering becoming more active, now is a great time! Physical exercise is without a doubt one of the best ways to break up your day and keep your body healthy.

	<img src = "images/yoga.jpg" alt = "Yoga Meditation" class = "breakingUpTheDay">
	</p>


	<p class = "subgeneral">
		<h3>Try Yoga or Meditation</h3>
	</p>
	<p class = "subgeneral">
		For anyone who prefers to break up the day in a relaxing, slow-paced environment, consider delving into yoga or meditation! Both are a great way to clear your mind throughout the day and stretch your stiff body. It's easy to start at home on your own too with a quick Google or YouTube search!
		<br><br>
	</p>

	<p class = "general">All in all, every little helps when it comes to looking after your mind and body. Whether you try one, some, or all of these tips or maybe find something different that works for you, make sure you do what you can for yourself and break up that long day of online learning!
