	<h2> About Online Learning 101 </h2>
	<br>
	<p class = "general"><em> Online Learning 101 </em> was designed to help college students tackle online college by combining the most helpful tips, tricks, and pieces of advice all in one place. As college students ourselves, we understand how strange and difficult it is facing coursework online during this pandemic. That's why we wanted to create this "101 guide" to hopefully help some of our classmates and others in the same boat as us.
	<br><br>
	The advice here on this website can be applied to all colleges / universities across Ireland for students studying a range of subjects at Bachelor's level.
