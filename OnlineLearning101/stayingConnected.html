	<h2> Staying Connected to Teachers and Classmates </h2>
	<br>
	<p class = "general">With college being remote for the forseeable future, keeping up to date with your peers may be more difficult. Let's discuss some ways in which you can keep yourself connected and help to close that gap.
	</p>

	<h3>Zoom</h3>
	<p class ="subgeneral">Zoom (or the equivalent) is our replacement for in-person classes. This is very different for a lot of us who have not experienced online learning or remote work. Here are some ways to engage with your classes and get the most out of them:
		<ul class = "stayingConnectedTable">
			<li>Show up!
				<p class="subgeneral">Showing up to class is the most important tip, whether you are online or in-person. Being there to catch all the material is half the battle, and what is put on your exams is no mystery. Any work that needs to be done will all have been discussed in your classes, each of which you should ideally have attended.</p>
			</li>
			<br><br>
			<li>Turn on your webcam
				<p class="subgeneral">This may be a hard one to put in to action, since most of us are quite shy about showing our face to the whole class. However, it's no different to being on campus normally! It may be daunting at first, but the more people that participate in this step, the more it feels like you are in a classroom again with your peers.</p>
			</li>
			<br><br>
			<li>Make sure to ask questions
				<p class="subgeneral">Chances are if you have thought of a question, several others are thinking it also. Online college can be hard enough to navigate as it is, make sure not to put extra pressure on yourself by trying to fumble through things you don't understand. Ask for any extra clarification or assistance where necessary, whether that is through email or during your class time.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Social Activities</h3>
	<p class ="subgeneral">Even though we may not be able to meet in person as we usually would - that doesn't mean that you can't plan social activities with your classmates. Explore the idea of creating some kind of group chat with any classmates who are interested in joining, to keep up to date with everyone and discuss class work together.
	<br><br>
	If you have a class representative, ask them about setting up a games night where you could all have a video call (since you already have Zoom, why not use that?) and hang out. You can do several things, such as play the same games together, watch youtube videos together (there are several websites to accommodate this), or just chat.
	</p>

	<img src = "images/reachingOut.jpeg" alt = "Reaching" class = "stayingConnected">

	<h3>Reach out!</h3>
	<p class ="subgeneral">Although it may be  daunting, take that first step to contacting your classmates and lectures. Don't be afraid to ask that question, send that email or start that conversation with a peer of yours. Everyone is in the same boat as you, lecturers will appreciate your effort to participate, and your classmates will appreciate you reaching out and chatting.</p>

	<p class ="general">We all have to help each other through this strange and new time.</p>
