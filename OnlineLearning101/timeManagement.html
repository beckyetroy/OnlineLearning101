	<h2> Time Management </h2></p>
	<br>
	<p class = "general"> Time management helps you to work smarter and more effectively, while taking less time. Bad time management may lead to tasks (such as study or assignments) taking more time than they should, leaving you under pressure and cutting deadlines short. 
	<br><br>
	In this section, we will discuss some tips for using your time wisely and getting the most out of your days.
	</p>

	<h3>Preparation</h3>
	<p class ="subgeneral">Preparing for your week ahead is an important step and should not be overlooked. 
	<br><br>
	While it may not always be ideal, treating college as a 9 to 5 job (even though you may not always have classes from 9 to 5 each day) is a good rule of time. Any time outside of class can be spent on study and assignments. This allows you to turn of your device at 5 each evening, knowing that you’ve given your work a good shot that day.
	<br><br>
	A great tip is to facilitate this is to sit down on the weekend and prepare for the week ahead. Sitting down with a piece of paper to map out your free time allows you to dedicate any time necessary to study and assignments, as well as allowing you to prioritise important tasks (such as upcoming deadlines). Colour coding each module can help you to keep track of your free time throughout the week at a quick glance of your handmade schedule.
	<br><br>
	Following this rule, and allowing for some extra assignment work and study on a weekend day of your choosing, should allow you to take a full day off at the weekend in good conscience.

	<h3>Study</h3>
	<p class ="subgeneral">Studying is an important part in preparing for exams. Make sure to leave plenty of time to revise, as trying to cram things in last minute will only lead to panic and stress.
	<br><br>
	Studying should be done in stints – it is not productive to force yourself to study for long periods of time without giving yourself a rest. The exact time you would like to study for is up to you – a good example is setting an alarm to allow you to study for 45 minutes and taking a 15 minute break to drink some water and step away from your desk.
	<br><br>
	Make sure to begin your studying in advance. This will allow you to pinpoint your trouble areas and ask for any help necessary in class for your lecturers. If you begin to work on all the material the weekend before, you could get stuck on some topics and trip yourself up.
	</p>

	<h3>Assignments</h3>
	<p class ="subgeneral">Assignments are a key component in any course. The main piece of advice to be given is to make sure you allow yourself plenty of time to work on these! Your lecturers are here to help, and will gladly help you with any problems or queries that arise as you work your way through it.
	<br><br>
	Another advantage to finishing assignments before the deadline is that you can ask your lecturer for their feedback – allowing you to potentially score some extra marks.
	<br> <br>
	Trying to complete a full assignment in just a day or two will lead to you feeling overwhelmed and producing work that is not your best quality. Submitting something that you know you have given your best shot at is a good feeling! Try to aim for that.
	</p>

	<p class="general">The overarching theme here, is to <i>make sure to allow yourself enough time</i>. Try to begin assignments soon after you receive them, and set goals to hit on them each week.<br><br></p>
